# Assignment 2 : String and Pointers

This assignment teaches how to use strings and pointers through practical steps.

Pointers
  -   Declare a pointer
  -   Declare a prototype for a function that accepts two integer arguements and 
  returns a pointer to a long integer
  -   Declare a prototype for a function that accepts a character pointer arguement
  and returns a pointer to a character. The function doesn't allow modification of 
  the input arguement
  -   Declare a one-dimensional array of integer pointers with 20 elements
  -   Declare an array of C strings whose initial values are "cyan", "magenta", 
  "yellow", and "black".
  
  Pure C Programming
  -   Create a C header to declare the functions later implemented
  -   Implement a function to return the number of lines from a given editing buffer.
  The editing buffer is passed to the function using pointer notation. The size of 
  the buffer is also be passed to the function. The function does not modify the 
  contents of the buffer, which is indicated in the function header.
  -   Implement a function that will search for multiple occurances of a given search
  string from a given editing buffer. The search string and editing buffer are both
  passed using pointer notation. Another array will also be passed, used to store the
  positions of the found occurrences of the search string in the buffer.
